RTK: Release the Krakens
========================

`Release the krakens` (RTK) is meant as a **task management scripting library** focused on retrieving data from online 
repositories and on applying a series of annotation (Segmentation with YALTAi, Clean Up, Kraken) while keeping the disk
space usage low (with some clean up function).

It provides few main classes which can be used together (see [`simple_text.py`](simple_test.py)).
